    "\n",
    "The cost function used in logistic regression is called log loss. It measures how well the model's predicted probabilities match the actual labels(0 or 1) for each data point.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In logistic regression regularization is crucial technique to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model training to well on training data but fails to generalize to unseen data.It works by penalizing the complexity of the model , essentially preventing it from overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does this prevent overfitting \n",
    "By penalizing larger coefficients both L1 and L2 regularization discourage the model from fitting too closely to random noise or irrelevant details in the training data. This forces model to focus on the important features."

    "\n",
    "The ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of a logistic regression model, especially in binary classification problems. It provides a visual representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) of your model at different classification thresholds.\n",

    "- Interpreting the ROC curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal ROC curve would hug the top left corner of the graph. This indicates a model with a high true positive rate (correctly identifying positive cases) and a low false positive rate (mistakenly identifying negative cases).\n",
    "The closer the curve is to the diagonal line, the less discriminative the model is. It suggests the model is no better than random guessing at distinguishing between positive and negative cases."

    "** Common Issues and Challenges in Logistic Regression:\n",
    "While logistic regression is a versatile tool, various potential issues can arise during implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multicollinearity:\n",
    "When independent variables are highly correlated, it becomes difficult to isolate the independent contribution of each to the outcome. This can lead to unstable coefficients and unreliable predictions.\n",
    "    - Solutions:\n",
    "Feature selection: Eliminate redundant features using techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance scores.\n",
    "Regularization: Use L1 or L2 regularization to shrink coefficients towards zero, effectively reducing the impact of correlated features.\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction: Transform features into a lower-dimensional space using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to address collinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model fits the training data too closely, failing to generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Solutions:\n",
    "Data augmentation: Increase the size and diversity of your training data using techniques like oversampling or synthetic data generation.\n",
    "Regularization: Apply L1 or L2 regularization to penalize complex models and encourage simpler, generalizable patterns.\n",
    "Early stopping: Halt training once the model's performance on a validation set starts to decline, preventing further overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Imbalanced Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "When one class significantly outnumbers the others, the model might be biased towards the majority class, neglecting the minority class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Solutions:\n",
    "Data-level techniques: Use undersampling, oversampling, or SMOTE to balance the class distribution.\n",
    "Algorithm-level techniques: Employ cost-sensitive learning, class-weighted logistic regression, or ensemble methods to focus on the minority class.\n",
    "Evaluation metrics: Use precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC AUC instead of accuracy to assess performance considering both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. High dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "With many features, interpreting the model becomes challenging, and computational costs can increase.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Solutions:\n",
    "Feature selection: Identify and remove irrelevant or redundant features using techniques like filter or wrapper methods.\n",
